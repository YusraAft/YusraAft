### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ”­ I am currently working on becoming well equipped with the necessary skills and experience to advance my knowledge in the field of computer science.
ğŸŒ± I am in my penultimate year of undergraduate study at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science. 
I have taken courses in C/C++ and Python and am currently pursuing Data Structures and Algorithms course
to engage in more efficient programming.
ğŸ‘¯ I am eager to collaborate on projects and help ideas come to life.
ğŸ¤” I am looking for help with learning more and am searching for an internship for Summer 2021. 
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my "out of the ordinary" ideas to transform technology
ğŸ“« You can reach me at aftabyusra786@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: I am at least bilingual and am learning a third language because I love languages both human and computer :)
ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
