### Hi there 👋
🔭 I am currently working on becoming well equipped with the necessary skills and experience to advance my knowledge in the field of computer science.

🌱 I am a computer science major at Northwestern University. 
I have taken courses in Python, web development and Java. I also have internship experience in Frontend work specifically with the React Framework.


👯 I am eager to collaborate on projects and help ideas come to life.

🤔 I am looking for help with learning more and am searching for full time opportunities in Frontend Software Engineering and UI/UX.

💬 Ask me about my "out of the ordinary" ideas to transform technology

📫 You can reach me at yusraaftab2023@u.northwestern.edu

⚡ Fun fact: I am bilingual and am learning a third language because I love languages :)

😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
