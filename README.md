### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ”­ I am currently working on becoming well equipped with the necessary skills and experience to advance my knowledge in the field of computer science.

ğŸŒ± I am in my penultimate year of undergraduate study at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science. 
I have taken courses in C/C++ and Python and recently completed a Data Structures and Algorithms course
to engage in more efficient programming.

ğŸ‘¯ I am eager to collaborate on projects and help ideas come to life.

ğŸ¤” I am looking for help with learning more and am searching for full time opportunities in Frontend Software Engineering and UI/UX.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my "out of the ordinary" ideas to transform technology

ğŸ“« You can reach me at yusraaftab2023@u.northwestern.edu

âš¡ Fun fact: I am bilingual and am learning a third language because I love languages both human and computer :)

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers

### Thank you so much for reading!
